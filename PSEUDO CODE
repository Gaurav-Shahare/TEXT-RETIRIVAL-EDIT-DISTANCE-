EDIT DISTANCE

PSEUDO CODE

For finding edit distance between two string, I have used  dynamic  programming paradigm

Let say two strings be A and B and i,j be the pointers pointing characters of them
edit(i,j) represents edit distance of string A[0,1,...i] and B[0,1,...j]
If(A[i]==B[j])
edit(i,j) =edit(i-1,j-1)
Else
edit(i,j)=1+min(A,B,C )
Where A=edit(i-1,j-1) // replace char j of string B
B=edit(i-1,j) // insert char at pos j of string B
C=edit(i,j-1) // delete char at pos j of string C


Finding thd edit distance between text all the given words would be costly so, I used ​ Trie​​ Data
Structure (This handel's punctuations and Capital word )
If edit distance between given text and some node j is less than two :
Print out all the children recursively from that node
Else:
Recursively find the node having the edit distance less than two


Further work
1) Time complexity can be further improved by adding few parameters to Trie
Example pointer to siblings
2) Whitespace handling
